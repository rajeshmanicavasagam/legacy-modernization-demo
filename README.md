# Legacy Modernization Demo (.NET)

## Overview
This repository demonstrates a **practical, low-risk approach** to modernizing a legacy .NET monolithic application into a cloud-ready architecture.

The focus is on **incremental modernization**, not a risky full rewrite.

## Why This Matters
Most enterprise systems:
- Were built as tightly coupled monoliths
- Are business-critical and hard to change
- Cannot be rewritten without major risk

This demo shows how such systems can be modernized **step by step**, while remaining stable in production.

## Scope
- Legacy ASP.NET-style monolith (simplified)
- Gradual extraction of functionality
- Introduction of modern ASP.NET Core APIs
- Architecture and migration decisions explained

> This is a design-focused demo.  
> Code is intentionally minimal; architecture and decision-making are the core.
